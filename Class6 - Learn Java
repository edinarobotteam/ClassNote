3. Homework
install github desktop, we will do merge next time.
using java method to generate method called  "findStringLength(string s)"
the method needs to count how many charters in this string.

generate another method called "sortArrayByLength( String[] arr )" this method will sort the array based on the length of each item.


For example, we have an array  String [] students={""Johnathon","Richard", "Maggie","Raya}

through these two methods, we will get a new array based on the length of students' name
String [] newstudents = {"Raya", "Maggie", "Richard","Johnathon"}
